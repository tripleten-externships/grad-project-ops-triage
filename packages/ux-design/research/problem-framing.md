# Problem Framing

## Problem Statement
<!-- TODO: Define the core problem the Request Management System solves -->

**Example:**
> Support teams receive requests through multiple fragmented channels (email, Slack, in-person), leading to lost requests, unclear priorities, and lack of visibility. This creates frustration for requesters who don't know status and for agents who struggle to prioritize work.

---

## Target Users
<!-- TODO: Identify the primary user groups -->

1. **Requesters**: <!-- Describe who submits requests -->
2. **Agents**: <!-- Describe who processes requests -->
3. **Managers**: <!-- Describe who oversees the system -->

---

## User Needs
<!-- TODO: List key needs for each user group -->

### Requesters
- [ ] Need 1: <!-- e.g., Submit requests easily -->
- [ ] Need 2: <!-- e.g., Track request status -->
- [ ] Need 3: <!-- e.g., Get timely updates -->

### Agents
- [ ] Need 1: <!-- e.g., See all pending requests in one place -->
- [ ] Need 2: <!-- e.g., Prioritize work effectively -->
- [ ] Need 3: <!-- e.g., Understand request context -->

### Managers
- [ ] Need 1: <!-- e.g., Monitor team performance -->
- [ ] Need 2: <!-- e.g., Identify bottlenecks -->
- [ ] Need 3: <!-- e.g., Track SLA compliance -->

---

## Business Goals
<!-- TODO: Define success criteria from business perspective -->

1. **Efficiency**: <!-- e.g., Reduce average resolution time by 30% -->
2. **Visibility**: <!-- e.g., 100% of requests tracked in system -->
3. **Satisfaction**: <!-- e.g., 90% user satisfaction score -->

---

## Constraints
<!-- TODO: List technical, business, or resource constraints -->

- **Technical**: <!-- e.g., Must integrate with existing auth system -->
- **Budget**: <!-- e.g., Use open-source tools where possible -->
- **Timeline**: <!-- e.g., MVP in 1 week (intensive bootcamp project) -->
- **Scope**: <!-- Reference user stories US-01, US-02, US-03 only -->

---

## Out of Scope
<!-- TODO: Clearly define what won't be addressed -->

- [ ] <!-- e.g., Mobile app (web only) -->
- [ ] <!-- e.g., Advanced workflow automation (Phase 2) -->
- [ ] <!-- e.g., Integration with external ticketing systems -->
